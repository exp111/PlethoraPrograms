# PlethoraPrograms
Just my little programs for use with Plethora Peripherals (written for Plethora Peripherals version 1.1.7-pr1 on Miencraft 1.12)
Aug 2, 2017

## Content
* PlethoraNeuralInterface.lua (for use with the Neural Interface)
* PlethoraModem.lua (used by a computer with a modem and a manipulator with a chat recorder module)

## Modular Features
* Mob Scanner (edit Mobs in config at the beginning of the program)
* Use Spammer
* Aimbot (doesn't work that well; just a simple proof-of-concept)
* Fall Reducer
* Hover
* Ore Scanner (edit Ores in config at the beginning of the program)

## How to use
Download the programs with wget or pastebin.
Just start the program and toggle features with the hotkeys (default: NumPad4 - NumPad9; configurable)

## Pastebin
* NeuralInterface: https://pastebin.com/0aFrJCPF
* Modem: https://pastebin.com/jh2FNSv9

## Problems
* Can't use the hotkeys? Open the neural connector or install a keyboard.
* Not enough module space in the neural interface? Deinstall the chat recorder and use a ender modem as a peripheral.
